# LargeOutflowTrap

---

## Description
The **LargeOutflowTrap** is a smart contract designed to be part of the Drosera system. Its purpose is to act as a monitoring mechanism, detecting large asset movements (outflows) from a specific wallet. This is intended to provide an early warning or trigger a preventative response when a significant amount of assets is moved, which is crucial for mitigating security risks such as asset theft from a compromised private key.

## How It Works
This contract monitors the balances of ETH, ERC-20, and ERC-721 tokens on a configured wallet address. Its functionality is split into two main parts:

1. **collect()**: This function gathers the latest balance data for ETH, all registered ERC-20 tokens, and all registered ERC-721 tokens. The data is then encoded into a *bytes* format and sent to the Drosera system.

2. **shouldRespond()**: This function receives the encoded data from *collect()*. It is designed to analyze each balance received. The contract will interpret a significant reduction in balance as a "large outflow." If the system detects that an asset's current balance has dropped below a pre-configured *threshold*, it will return *true* to indicate that an anomaly has occurred and a response should be triggered.

## Use Cases
This contract has several important use cases, particularly for digital asset security:

1. Theft Protection
If a crypto wallet is compromised by a cybercriminal, they will likely try to move all assets as quickly as possible. With the *LargeOutflowTrap*, any large asset movement that exceeds the *threshold* will be immediately flagged by the Drosera system. This can trigger automated responses, such as:

- Locking the wallet (if integrated with a locking mechanism).

- Sweeping the remaining assets to a safer wallet.

- Sending notifications to the wallet owner via various channels (email, Telegram, etc.).

2. Mitigating Compromised Private Key Risk
A compromised private key is one of the most significant risks in the crypto world. By setting a relatively low *threshold* for valuable assets, you can use the *LargeOutflowTrap* to immediately detect any unusual asset movement. This allows you to act quickly and secure your remaining assets before they are all drained.

3. Whale Monitoring
For individuals or entities that manage very large amounts of assets ("whales"), this contract can be used for passive monitoring. While not always an indicator of an attack, a large asset movement from a primary wallet can be an event that warrants further attention, such as portfolio rebalancing or an over-the-counter (OTC) transaction.

## Configuration
To use this contract, you will need to modify the parameters within the **constructor()**:

- **myWallet**: Replace the *0x123...* address with the address of the wallet you want to monitor.

**threshold**: Set the threshold for ETH. For example, if you want to be notified when your ETH balance drops below 1 ETH, set *threshold = 1 ether;*.

**erc20Tokens**: Add the contract addresses of the ERC-20 tokens you want to monitor to this array.

**erc721Tokens**: Add the contract addresses of the NFT ERC-721 tokens you want to monitor to this array.

With the right configuration, the **LargeOutflowTrap** becomes a vigilant, passive guard ready to protect your digital assets from unexpected threats.
